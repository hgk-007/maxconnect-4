Evaluation function:find_best_move
When the user enters the depth value, the evaluation function calculates the utility values for the min and max. 

Based on the state of the game the evaluation function assigns a value.

Whenever there are four occurences say 1111 or 2222 vertically, horizontlly or diagonally the value increases by 1.

Similarly for every three occurences say 111 or 222 vertically or horizontally the value increaes by 0.80 and for two occurences it increases by 0.20.

If there are three values diagonally and theres an empty space in the fourth space then it increases the value by 0.70. 

All these values are negative for the other player. The evaluation function finally sums all these values and returns the utility value.
